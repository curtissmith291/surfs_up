## Overview of the Analysis

W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.


## Results

Major Points:

- 1700 temperature data points were collected in June
- 1517 temperature data points were collected in December


## Summary

The average temperatures for June and December were 75F and 71F, displaying little change between the two months. The minimum temperature in December was 56F, though only 25% of temperatures were between 69F and 56F, suggesting that most days had a suitable temperature for surfing, with the warmer days being suitable for ice cream. Additional research shows that the water temperature in Oahu is 77F on average, warm enough for surfing, even on colder days.  

Additionally, the standard deviations for June and December were 3.3F and 3.7F, respectively, suggesting that there is very little variability in the deviation from the mean temperature.

Determining the relationship, if any, between temperature and precipitation could be useful for determining the viability of operating in December.
